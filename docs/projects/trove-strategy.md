# Trove Strategy

> Product strategy for the Spatial Puzzle Protocol for Digital Treasure

---

## Executive Summary

Trove is positioned to become the **infrastructure layer for trustless conditional access** to digital value. While competitors in escrow, inheritance, and gaming prizes require trusted intermediaries, Trove uses zero-knowledge proofs and spatial puzzles to enable programmable release of assets without any third party.

**Strategic thesis**: Every conditional transfer of value (escrow, inheritance, contests, rewards) currently requires trust. ZK proofs eliminate that requirement. Whoever builds the best trustless conditional access protocol captures a massive horizontal market.

### Positioning & Differentiation

#### Core Positioning Statement

> For anyone who needs to conditionally release digital value, Trove is the only protocol that combines spatial puzzles with zero-knowledge proofs, enabling trustless treasure hunts, escrow, inheritance, and contests without any intermediary.

#### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters | Proof Points |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Spatial Puzzles** | Engaging, memorable, shareable | Password Palace technology |
| **ZK Verification** | No one sees the solution until solved | Halo2 proofs |
| **Piece Distribution** | Flexible access control | NFT pieces, conditions |
| **Deflationary Token** | Aligned incentives | 40% fee burn |
| **Cosmos Ecosystem** | IBC connectivity | Cross-chain value |
| **Own Chain** | Optimized for use case | Trove-specific modules |

#### Messaging Pillars

1. **"Digital treasure, trustlessly secured"** - Core value
2. **"The first to solve it wins"** - Gamification
3. **"No lawyers, no escrow agents, just math"** - Trust architecture
4. **"Treasure hunts for the internet age"** - Consumer appeal

### SWOT Analysis

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Novel product (no direct competitor) | Requires ZK understanding |
| Password Palace tech synergy | Cold start (network effects needed) |
| Engaging gamification | Complex to explain |
| Deflationary tokenomics | Crypto-native only initially |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Brand campaign market huge | Larger platform adds feature |
| Inheritance is underserved | Regulatory scrutiny |
| Rising Sun ecosystem | ZK technology moves fast |
| NFT distribution evolution | Token may not gain traction |

| **Staking for validators** | Supply lock |
| **Governance** | Utility demand |
| **Piece minting** | Usage demand |

### Pricing Strategy

#### Protocol Fee Philosophy

2. **High enough for token value** - Burns must be meaningful
3. **Creator-aligned** - Hint revenue shares

#### Campaign Pricing

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **DIY** | Protocol fees only | Self-service tools |
| **Starter** | $10K | Setup support, basic promotion |
| **Growth** | $50K | Full service, influencer outreach |

| **Avg Trove value** | $200 | Mix of high/low |
| **Protocol fee** | ~$0.10 | Creation + solve |
| **Campaign Troves (branded)** | 10,000 | Per campaign |
| **Campaign revenue** | $1,000+ | Fees + services |

#### Token Economics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 1B $TROVE | Fixed |
| **Annual burn (Y1)** | ~10M | Estimated usage |
| **Effective inflation** | -1% | Deflationary |
| **Validator rewards** | From treasury | Non-inflationary |

### Revenue Projections

## IV. Token Strategy

### $TROVE Token Design

#### Utility

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Protocol fees** | All actions require $TROVE |
| **Staking** | Validators stake to participate |
| **Governance** | Vote on protocol parameters |
| **Piece minting** | Mint NFT pieces |
| **Hint purchase** | Buy hints for puzzles |

#### Distribution

| Allocation | % | Vesting |
|------------|---|---------|
| **Community Chest** | 30% | Earned via solving |
| **Foundation** | 20% | 4-year unlock |
| **Team** | 15% | 4-year cliff+vest |
| **Investors** | 15% | 2-year vest |
| **Ecosystem Grants** | 10% | As needed |
| **Liquidity** | 10% | At launch |

#### Value Accrual

```
Usage grows
    │
    ▼
More fees collected
    │
    ├──► 40% burned → Supply decreases
    │
    ├──► 40% to Chest → Drives more usage (gamification)
    │
    └──► 20% to Foundation → Ecosystem development

Result: Usage directly reduces supply, increasing scarcity
```

### Launch Strategy

#### Phase 1: Testnet ($TROVE on testnet)
- Free tokens for testing
- No value, pure utility testing

#### Phase 2: Genesis Launch
- Initial distribution via airdrop + early supporters
- DEX liquidity on Osmosis
- Validator set activated

#### Phase 3: Exchange Listings
- CEX listings based on traction
- Additional DEX pools
- Market making partnerships
