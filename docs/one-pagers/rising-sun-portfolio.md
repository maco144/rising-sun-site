**Infrastructure for a Free Internet**

---

## The Thesis

We're building the foundational layers for an internet where:
- **You own your identity** (not platforms)
- **You own your AI** (not corporations)
- **You transact trustlessly** (not through intermediaries)
- **You play anywhere** (not behind download walls)

Five integrated products. One coherent vision. $25M+ ARR by 2027.

**Competitors can't match**: Even if they replicate one product, they can't replicate the integrated ecosystem.

## Why Now

| Shift | Implication | Our Position |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| ZK proofs are practical | Consumer-grade privacy possible | Already built (PP, Trove) |
| AI is truly capable | Autonomous agents viable | Already built (Eudaimonia) |
| Web tech is powerful | Browser = app platform | Already built (Forgeground) |
| Crypto infrastructure mature | Trustless systems work | Already built (GameGames) |

**Window**: 2026-2028. First movers establish positions or well-funded competitors catch up.

---

## Traction

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Products in development | 5 |
| Code written | 50K+ lines |
| Tests (Eudaimonia alone) | 2,200+ |
| Technical moats | ZK circuits, hivemind protocol, physics engine |

## 2026-2027 Milestones

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Q1 2026 | Password Palace public beta, GameGames mainnet |
| Q2 2026 | Eudaimonia 1K instances, Forgeground public beta |
| Q3 2026 | Trove mainnet + $TROVE, first brand campaigns |
| Q4 2026 | Ecosystem integration complete, first profitable quarter |
| 2027 | $25M+ ARR, 500K+ users across ecosystem |

## Financial Summary

| Scenario | 2027 ARR | Basis |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Conservative** | $15M | Slower adoption, fewer enterprise deals |
| **Moderate** | $25.6M | Current projections |
| **Aggressive** | $60M+ | Eudaimonia network effects, viral Forgeground |

**Path to profitability**: Q4 2026 at ~$400K MRR

## The Ask

Building infrastructure for a different kind of internet.

- **Developers**: The code is open. Build with us.
- **Users**: Try the products. Experience what's possible.
- **Investors**: This is infrastructure. Identity, AI, gaming, assets — foundational layers.
