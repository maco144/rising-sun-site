**Trustless Skill-Based Wagering**

---

## The Problem

Skill gaming platforms charge 10-20% fees, require trusting centralized operators with your money, and can freeze funds arbitrarily. Players have no guarantee of fair play or honest payouts.

## The Solution

GameGames enables **trustless wagering** on competitive games. Smart contracts hold funds (we literally cannot steal them), AI verifies outcomes, and winners are paid instantly. All for **2.5% fees** — 6x better economics than competitors.

```
Bet on yourself, trustlessly.
2.5% fees (they charge 15%).
We literally can't steal your money.
```

## How It Works

```
1. Create wager → 2. Opponent accepts → 3. Play match
        ↓                   ↓                  ↓
   Define terms      Funds locked in      Complete game
                     smart contract

4. Submit proof → 5. AI verifies → 6. Winner paid
        ↓                ↓               ↓
