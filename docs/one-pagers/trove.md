# Trove

**Trustless Conditional Access to Digital Value**

---

## The Problem

Every conditional transfer of value — escrow, inheritance, contest prizes, promotional rewards — requires trusting an intermediary. Escrow agents charge fees and can disappear. Lawyers are expensive. Platforms can freeze your funds.

## The Solution

Trove uses **zero-knowledge proofs** and **spatial puzzles** to enable programmable release of assets without any third party. Lock tokens in a Trove, set conditions (puzzle, time, multi-party), and math guarantees the release. No lawyers, no escrow agents, just math.

```
Digital treasure, trustlessly secured.
The first to solve it wins.
No intermediaries, just mathematics.
```

## How It Works

```
1. CREATE          2. LOCK           3. DISTRIBUTE
   Design your        Deposit           Give pieces to
   spatial puzzle     tokens/NFTs       recipients

4. SOLVE           5. VERIFY         6. CLAIM
   Collect pieces     ZK proof          Winner receives
   + solve puzzle     confirms          contents
```
