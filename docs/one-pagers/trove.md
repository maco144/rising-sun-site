# Trove

**Trustless Conditional Access to Digital Value**

---

## The Problem

Every conditional transfer of value — escrow, inheritance, contest prizes, promotional rewards — requires trusting an intermediary. Escrow agents charge fees and can disappear. Lawyers are expensive. Platforms can freeze your funds.

## The Solution

Trove is an **entirely new category** of asset protection — not another escrow service, but a fundamental rethinking of conditional access. Instead of trusting intermediaries, users leverage **spatial puzzles, time-locks, multi-party requirements, and cryptographic conditions** to control when and how value is released.

Combined with **zero-knowledge proofs**, the conditions are enforced by mathematics. No lawyers, no escrow agents, just math.

```
Digital treasure, trustlessly secured.
The first to solve it wins.
No intermediaries, just mathematics.
```

## Access Modalities

Trove offers multiple user-friendly ways to protect and release value:

| Modality | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Spatial Puzzles** | Navigate 3D environments to unlock contents |
| **Time-Locks** | Release after specific dates or durations |
| **Multi-Party** | Require multiple participants to unlock |
| **Piece Collection** | Gather distributed fragments to complete access |
| **Conditional Triggers** | Release based on external events or data |

**Always evolving**: Trove continuously develops new access conditions, making trustless escrow more flexible and accessible. The protocol grows with users, adding modalities that match real-world needs.

## How It Works

```
1. CREATE          2. LOCK           3. DISTRIBUTE
   Design your        Deposit           Give pieces to
   spatial puzzle     tokens/NFTs       recipients

4. SOLVE           5. VERIFY         6. CLAIM
   Collect pieces     ZK proof          Winner receives
   + solve puzzle     confirms          contents
```

## Key Differentiators

| Trustless | Yes (ZK proofs) | No | Partial |
| Gamified | Yes (puzzles) | No | No |
| Programmable conditions | Yes | Limited | Limited |
| Can intermediary steal? | No | Yes | Signers can |
| Engaging for users | Yes (treasure hunts) | No | No |
