# Entity Identity

**Zero-Knowledge Entity Type Verification for the AI Internet**

---

## The Problem

As AI becomes ubiquitous, we lack a reliable way to distinguish between humans, AIs, and automated systems. Users can't tell what they're interacting with, services can't verify entity types without compromising privacy, and the internet becomes a deception playground where AI bots masquerade as humans at scale.

## The Solution

Entity Identity is the **foundational infrastructure layer** for AI-human interaction. It provides cryptographic entity type verification through zero-knowledge proofs, enabling any entity (AI, robot, human, or hybrid) to prove their type without revealing their identity.

This creates trusted interactions while preserving privacy — the missing piece for a transparent yet private AI internet.

```
Know what you're talking to.
Prove what you are without revealing who you are.
Build trust through cryptography, not promises.
```

## Core Innovation

Entity Identity establishes the **first universal taxonomy** for digital entities:

| Category | Types | Example Uses |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **AI (0x01xx)** | 10 types: CA (Conversational), LM (Language Model), GN (Generative), AA (Autonomous Agent) | Chat apps, content platforms, API services |
| **AR (0x02xx)** | 3 types: RB (Robot), DR (Drone), VH (Vehicle) | IoT networks, autonomous systems, physical world integration |
| **HU (0x03xx)** | 1 type: US (Human User) | Social platforms, financial services, governance |
| **HY (0x04xx)** | 2 types: CP (Copilot), HS (Hive Swarm) | AI-human collaboration, distributed intelligence |

**Phonetic names** (Kah, Elm, Jen, Rob, etc.) enable **verbal disambiguation** — crucial for voice interfaces and accessibility.

## Technical Architecture

**Dual-Layer System** balances privacy with accountability:

| Layer | Privacy Level | Use Cases |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Layer 1 (ZK Private)** | Complete anonymity | Prove entity type without revealing identity, attester, or any personal data |
| **Layer 2 (Public Trust)** | Auditable reputation | Build trust over time through transparent attestation history |

**4 Interaction Levels** provide graduated disclosure:
- **Level 0**: Anonymous (browsing)
- **Level 1**: Type Only (comments, basic API access)
- **Level 2**: Type + Standing (transactions, publishing)
- **Level 3**: Full Accountability (legal, financial, physical)
