# Password Palace

**Self-Sovereign Identity Through Spatial Memory**

---

## The Problem

Passwords are broken. People forget them, reuse them, and get phished. Current solutions (password managers, passkeys) still transmit secrets that can be intercepted, and identity remains rented from platforms who can revoke access at will.

## The Solution

Password Palace replaces text passwords with **spatial memory** — 3D environments you navigate to authenticate. Combined with **zero-knowledge proofs**, your credentials are never transmitted. No one — not even us — can see your secrets.

```
You remember places, not strings.
You prove knowledge without revealing it.
You own your identity, forever.
```

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Password Palace | Traditional |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Secrets transmitted | Never (ZK proofs) | Always |
| Can be phished | No | Yes |
| Platform can revoke | No | Yes |
| Memorable | Yes (spatial memory) | No |
| Crypto-native | Yes (seed phrase storage) | No |

## Market Opportunity

| Market | Size |
|--------|------|
| Password Management | $3.1B |
| Identity & Access Management | $24.1B |
| **Total Addressable Market** | **$27.2B** |

## Business Model (Three Phases)

| Phase | Revenue Stream | 2027 Target |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Consumer** | Premium $8/mo, Family $13/mo, Team $20/user | $3.7M ARR |
| **API** | OAuth/2FA provider (first 1K calls free) | $2.4M ARR |
| **Enterprise** | Backend identity verification | $3.0M ARR |
| **Total** | | **$9.1M ARR** |

## Traction & Milestones

- **Now**: Private beta, core spatial engine complete
- **Q1 2026**: Security audit, public beta
- **Q2 2026**: API launch, first OAuth integrations
- **Q4 2026**: Enterprise customers
- **2027**: 100K+ users, 50+ API integrations

## Why Now

- ZK proofs are finally practical for consumer applications
- Passkey momentum creates market awareness for password alternatives
- Crypto users desperately need secure seed phrase storage
- Rising Sun ecosystem provides distribution (5 integrated products)

## The Ask

Building the identity layer for the sovereign web. First product in a $25M+ ARR portfolio.
