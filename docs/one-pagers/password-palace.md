# Password Palace

**Self-Sovereign Identity Through Spatial Memory**

---

## The Problem

Passwords are broken. People forget them, reuse them, and get phished. Current solutions (password managers, passkeys) still transmit secrets that can be intercepted, and identity remains rented from platforms who can revoke access at will.

## The Solution

Password Palace is an **entirely new category** of authentication — not an incremental improvement, but a fundamental rethinking of how humans prove identity. Instead of memorizing arbitrary strings, users leverage natural human memory: **scenes, melodies, screenshots, gestures, and spatial navigation**.

Combined with **zero-knowledge proofs**, your credentials are never transmitted. No one — not even us — can see your secrets.

```
You remember places, not strings.
You prove knowledge without revealing it.
You own your identity, forever.
```

## Authentication Modalities

Password Palace offers multiple user-friendly ways to prove identity:

| Modality | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **3D Scenes** | Navigate rooms, interact with objects in memorable spaces |
| **Melodies** | Hum or tap a personal tune only you know |
| **Screenshots** | Select specific regions of images you remember |
| **Gestures** | Draw patterns or air-sign your unique signature |
| **Spatial Paths** | Trace routes through personalized environments |

**Always evolving**: Password Palace continuously develops new authentication methods, making proof easier and more accessible. The platform grows with users, adding modalities that match how people naturally remember.

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Password Palace | Traditional |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Approach | Novel (memory-based) | Incremental (text-based) |
| Auth methods | Multiple (scenes, melodies, gestures) | Single (passwords/passkeys) |
| Secrets transmitted | Never (ZK proofs) | Always |
| Can be phished | No | Yes |
| Platform can revoke | No | Yes |
| Memorable | Yes (natural memory) | No |
| Crypto-native | Yes (seed phrase storage) | No |

## Market Opportunity

| Market | Size |
|--------|------|
