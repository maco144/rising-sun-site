**The Most Accessible Serious Competitive FPS**

---

## The Problem

Quality competitive gaming requires 50-100GB downloads, expensive hardware, and long update queues. Browser games exist but lack the fidelity and competitive depth that serious players demand.

## The Solution

Forgeground is an **entirely new category** of competitive gaming — not another browser game, but a fundamental rethinking of accessible esports. Instead of choosing between quality and convenience, players get **AAA-level gameplay with zero downloads** through cutting-edge browser technology.

Unique **physics manipulation weapons** and **multiple combat systems** create high skill-ceiling gameplay. Deep ranked systems and native wagering integration through GameGames.

Click. Play. Compete.

Physics is your weapon.
