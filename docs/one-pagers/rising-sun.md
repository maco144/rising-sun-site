**Communication Where History is Opt-in**

---

## The Problem

Every communication platform remembers everything forever. Messages, logins, metadata — all stored permanently, ready to be leaked, subpoenaed, or sold. Users have zero control over their digital history. Identity requires trusting third parties who can be hacked, coerced, or disappear.

## The Solution

Rising Sun is an **entirely new category** of communication infrastructure — not another encrypted messenger, but a fundamental rethinking of how communication works. Instead of platforms that remember everything, Rising Sun creates shared spaces where **the world only knows current state**.

Want proof something happened? YOU keep the receipt. No receipt = no proof = never happened.

```
The world forgets. You choose what to remember.
Identity from what you know, not who vouches for you.
Proof requires consent.
```

## Novel Approach

Rising Sun inverts the assumptions of modern communication:

| Traditional Platforms | Rising Sun |
|----------------------|------------|
| Platform stores everything | World only knows NOW |
| History is permanent | History requires receipts |
| Identity = account + password | Identity = spatial knowledge |
| Platform can prove you were there | Only YOU can prove presence |
| Subpoena gets your history | No history to subpoena |
| Trust the server | Trust the math |

## Access Modalities

Rising Sun offers multiple ways to participate in shared spaces:

| Modality | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Spatial Identity** | Arrange objects in 3D → deterministic hash → permanent ID |
| **Channels** | Real-time E2E encrypted chat, ephemeral by default |
| **Forums** | Threaded discussions with optional permanence |
| **Troves** | Multi-party unlock via distributed pieces |
| **Receipts** | Cryptographic proof of presence, kept by users |

**Always evolving**: Rising Sun continuously develops new region types and interaction patterns, making consent-based communication more flexible. The protocol grows with users.

## How It Works

```
1. CREATE IDENTITY     2. ENTER REGION       3. INTERACT
   Spatial arrangement    Join channel/forum    Send messages,
   becomes your ID        as Merkle leaf        place objects

4. GENERATE RECEIPT    5. KEEP OR DISCARD    6. PROVE LATER
   Capture current        Your choice what     Merkle proof
   world state            to remember          validates
```

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Rising Sun | Signal | Matrix | Session |
|---------|------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Identity source | Spatial memory | Phone number | Account | Random key |
| History model | Opt-in receipts | Stored locally | Stored on servers | Stored locally |
| Metadata stored | None | Some | Yes | Minimal |
| Requires trust | No (Merkle proofs) | Signal Foundation | Homeserver | Network |
| Consent-based memory | Yes | No | No | No |
| Self-sovereign ID | Yes | No | Partial | Yes |

## Market Opportunity

| Market | Size |
|--------|------|
| Secure Messaging | $8B |
| Identity Management | $15B |
| Collaboration Tools | $45B |
| Web3 Identity | $2B |
| **Total Addressable Market** | **$70B** |

## Business Model

| Phase | Focus | Revenue |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Protocol & SDK** | Developer infrastructure | Open source, ecosystem value |
| **Consumer Apps** | Chat, Spaces, Identity apps | Freemium ($5-20/mo premium) |
| **Ecosystem Foundation** | Identity layer for Rising Sun products | Shared infrastructure |

**2027 Target**: $120K ARR from premium features and managed services

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Private Messaging** | Journalists communicating with sources |
| **Team Collaboration** | Remote teams with consent-based history |
| **Event Attendance** | Prove you attended without surveillance |
| **DAO Communication** | Governance discussions with selective transparency |
| **Cross-Product Identity** | One identity across Password Palace, Trove, GameGames |

## Ecosystem Integration

```
RISING SUN ─────► PASSWORD PALACE
                  Shared spatial primitives
                  Unified identity

RISING SUN ─────► TROVE
                  Piece distribution via regions
                  Multi-party coordination

RISING SUN ─────► GAMEGAMES
                  Match coordination channels
                  Player identity
```

## Traction & Milestones

- **Now**: Core protocol complete, browser client with E2E encryption
- **Q2 2026**: P2P beta, mobile SDK, developer documentation
- **Q3 2026**: Chat app public beta, Password Palace integration
- **Q4 2026**: Trove integration, federation alpha
- **2027**: 25K active identities, full ecosystem integration

## Technical Foundation

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Identity | Spatial memory → SHA-256 → User ID |
| World State | Sparse Merkle Tree |
| Encryption | X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Signatures | Ed25519 |
| Network | WebSocket + WebRTC (P2P) |
| ZK-Ready | Poseidon hashing |

## The Ask

Building consent-based communication infrastructure for the internet. Private messaging today, ecosystem identity layer tomorrow.
