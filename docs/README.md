# Rising Sun - Technology for Human Flourishing

> *An internet where users are safe, AIs are allies, and power flows from big tech to the people.*

## The Vision

We're building technology that serves humanity rather than extracting from it. Every project shares three principles:

### 1. User Safety First
Technology that protects users by design - not by policy, not by promise, but by mathematics and cryptography.

### 2. AI as Ally
Artificial intelligence that augments human capability, works *for* users (not on them), and operates transparently.

### 3. Decentralization
Systems where no single entity - including us - can censor, freeze, or control user access.

## Shared Foundation

These projects aren't random - they share technology and philosophy:

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Password Palace and Trove share Halo2 circuits for proving you know a secret without revealing it. This same technology could extend to identity verification, voting, and credential systems.

### Spatial Interfaces
3D/spatial thinking appears throughout: Password Palace rooms, Trove puzzles, Forgeground arenas. Humans think spatially - our interfaces should reflect that.

### AI Integration
Every project uses AI appropriately: Eudaimonia *is* an AI system, GameGames uses AI for verification, and the others can integrate AI assistance.

## Why This Matters

The current internet is broken:
- **Passwords** are phished, leaked, and forgotten daily
- **AI** is used to surveil and manipulate rather than help
- **Platforms** own your data, your identity, your access
- **Gaming** is locked in walled gardens with extractive monetization

We're building alternatives. Not as protest, but as proof that better is possible.

---

## For Different Audiences

### For Users
You get tools that respect you: authentication that can't be phished, AI that works for you, games without gatekeepers, assets you actually own.

### For Developers
Open-source foundations you can build on: ZK circuits, spatial protocols, AI agent architectures, multiplayer networking.

### For Investors
Early-stage infrastructure for the next internet: identity, AI assistants, gaming, and digital asset management - all with defensible technology moats.
